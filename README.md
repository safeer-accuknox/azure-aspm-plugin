## Development & Build Notes

- **Compile TypeScript**: Navigate to the `src` directory and run `tsc` to transpile `*.ts` files to `*.js` for JavaScript execution. Ignore any errors during the compilation process.
- **Package the Extension**: Move back to the root directory. Use `npx tfx-cli extension create` to generate the `.vsix` file (plugin package). Ensure the version in `task.json` and `vss-extension.json` is updated before creating the package.
- **Upload to Marketplace**: After generating the .vsix file, upload it to the Visual Studio Marketplace
